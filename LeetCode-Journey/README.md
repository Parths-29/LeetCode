## 👋 Hey there!

Welcome to my LeetCode grind repository — this is where I document my **problem-solving journey**, one solution at a time.

I'm **Parth**, a developer who believes that consistent practice is the real secret sauce. This repo isn't just a collection of accepted submissions — it's a honest record of how I think, approach, and eventually crack problems ranging from *"wait, this is easy?"* to *"how does anyone figure this out??"*

## 🧩 What You'll Find Here

- **Clean, readable solutions** — not just code that passes, but code I'd be proud to show in an interview
- **Multiple approaches** where applicable — brute force first, then optimized
- **Honest commits** — including the days I struggled and revised

## 🔥 Why I'm Doing This

I started this journey to get better at **problem-solving and algorithmic thinking**. Posting solutions publicly keeps me accountable and hopefully helps someone else who's stuck on the same problem at 2am.

If one of my solutions helped you understand something — that makes the whole thing worth it. 🙌
